# City List & Time

### What’s This?
This project shows a list of cities. You can click on any city to see its current local time. The active city gets a highlight with a moving indicator.

### Files
- index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the page.
- css/styles.css: This file has all the styles that make the page look nice.
- js/script.js: This JavaScript file handles the interactive parts, like fetching data and updating the time.
- data/navigation.json: This JSON file contains the data for the cities, including their names and time zones.

### How to Use
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Click on a city name to see the current time for that city.
3. The selected city will be highlighted, and the current time will show up below.

### Accessibility
- Keyboard Navigation: You can use the Enter or Space key to select a city.
- Screen Readers: I’ve made sure screen readers will announce the time updates and highlight the active city.
